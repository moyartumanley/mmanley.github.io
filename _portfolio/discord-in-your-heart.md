Description:
----
Banned for sending a meme in general? Face the ultimate social challenge! In 'Discord In Your Heart', navigate a branching narrative where your wit and charm are your only weapons. Interact with three distinct server moderators, each with their own quirks and conditions for your return. Will you butter them up, appeal to their sense of humor, or perhaps even find a surprising connection along the way? Your fate *(and server access)* hangs in the balance!

### Background:
Our team created a Discord-inspired visual novel game for a 48 Cupid Game Jam hosted by Game Devs @ Mac. The idea arose during an hour-long brainstorming session, and we found that creating a game via Ren'Py, a python-based visual novel engine, would be the most optimal given our time constraints. We worked to ensure some level of customization, as players are able to determine their username and profile picture, as well as achieve their desired ending. Due to the time limit, we had to limit the amount of features we wanted to add such as minigames and favorability. 

### Awards:
There were a total of four award categories that participants' games were be critiqued on:
* **Most Rizz** - Given to the game that showcases the most charisma, charm, and style. After playing this game, the player is wooed by the game and has instantly fallen in love with it.
* **Life-Changing** - Given to the game that has made a serious impact on the player’s life. It could’ve been the touching characters, challenging, but rewarding gameplay, or its breathtaking art. What’s most crucial is that the game gave the player a profound experience that could not be replicated.
* **Cupid’s Choice** - An audience-voted category where other Macalester game jam participants, students, staff, and faculty can vote for their favorite game featured in the game jam.
* **Coolest Gameplay Feature** - given to the game that gives the player that *“Ah-ha!”* moment. This game’s unique feature challenges the expectations of both the player and other games and goes far beyond what is the status quo.

Our game was recognized with the following awards:
* Most Rizz
* Life-Changing
* Cupid's Choice

### System Requirements:
You can play our game as an HTML5 game on [itch.io](https://moyartumanley.itch.io/discord-in-your-heart).

### Accessibility:
The game includes a self-voicing mode that uses a speech synthesizer to read on-screen text and interface elements, making it more accessible for visually impaired players. There are audio cues such as Discord pings, however, they are not essential to the gaming experience. Basic keyboard navigation is also supported for menu and choice selection.
