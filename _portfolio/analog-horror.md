Description:
----
### Background:
The Analog Horror Game was created as the final project for COMP127: Object-Oriented Programming. Working with two classmates, we aimed to showcase the skills acquired during the semester.

Our goal was to develop a point-and-click horror game inspired by Analog Horror media using the Kilt Graphics API. Thus, our game is one in which you act in opposition to an entity that is targeting you by problem-solving, taking advantage of item interactions, and defensive thinking. 

To achieve this, we implemented a start menu, a basic inventory system, and audio to accompany our original visual assets. Narrative and instructional text accompany the player throughout the game.

### Limitations:
* The program is designed to run in a non-scalable window that measures at 854 x 480 px. 
* The mouse is the game's sole input, but it is not designed to handle dragging the cursor while the left mouse button is depressed.
* The ambient audio only plays for 10 minutes â€” if you take longer than that to complete the game you must do so in silence. 

Running the Game:

### System Requirements:
The game is capable of running on any system with Java 17. However, a device capable of inputting a left mouse click is necessary for in-game navigation.

### How to Run:
1. Locally clone the repo.
2. Navigate to `Analog-Horror-Game/src/analoghorror/HorrorGame.java`
3. Press run! 

All required assets are included within the program, thus no additional downloads are required.

### Accessibility Warnings:
* The game is predominantly in low resolution and in black and white. 
* Labels are not screen-reader accessible due to the time limitations. 
* Audio is used to create jumpscapes, thus be mindful of volume, especially if wearing headphones.
* Game features timed events, which may create stress or discomfort.
